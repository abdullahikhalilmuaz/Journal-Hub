            <strong>M</strong>aximum length of a Regular Article is 4,000 words
            of text - not counting the abstract, Tables, figure legends, and
            reference. Abstract shouldn not exceed 200 words and should be
            constructed as a single narrative paragraph with no subheadings or
            references. Submissions are limited to a total of 7 figures, and
            digiral images are required. We recomment limiting references to
            100. The sections of a Regular Article should be ordered Abstract,
            Introduction, Methods (should include sufficient information to
            allow readers to understand the article content). Results (showing
            Tables, Figure Legends, and Figures), Discussion Acknowledgement,
            Disclosure of Conflict of interest, Reference and Appendix.

            <strong>S</strong>hort manuscripts definitively documenting either
            experimental results or informative observations will be considered
            for publication in this category. Single case reports or case series
            can only be accomodated. if they educate very novel and important
            findings e.g. disease biology or approaches for therapy. Brief
            Reports ar not intended to allow publication of incomplege or
            preliminary findings. The review process is equally rigorous as for
            Regular Artcles and acceptance rate is lower, Brief Reports may not
            exceed 1,200 words of text not counting the abstract, figure
            legends, and reference, abstract must not exceed 150 words and
            should be a single paragraph with no subheadings. Only 2
            figures/tables and 25 references may be included. The sections of a
            Brief Report should be ordered regular articles, but results and
            discussion should be combined.
